# Practical Assignments for Network Science

This repository contains practical assignments on network analysis. All assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks, that can be done by writing code instead of the line 
```
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
All notebooks contain test cells with `assert` statements that help you understand whether your code is correct.

Topics:
1. [Introduction to network science and power law](assignment_intro_power_law/assignment.ipynb)
2. [Generative network models](assignment_gen_models/assignment.ipynb)
3. [Node centrality measures](assignment_centrality/assignment.ipynb)
4. [Link analysis and structure properties](assignment_link_analysis/assignment.ipynb)
5. [Community detetction](assignment_community_detection/assignment.ipynb)

Here are also descriptions of some competitions held among students to solve practical tasks on graphs:
1. [Network Generation](competition_network_generation/competition.ipynb)
